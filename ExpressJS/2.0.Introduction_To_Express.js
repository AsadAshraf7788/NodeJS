/*
What and why ?


Writing the server side code is really tough
Remember the Name extracted from HTML element

We did
1. Write Straming 
2. Add Buffer
3. Gather the buffer at Bus stop


1. Build in Parsing data thing + help gate way for 3rd party parsers
2. No nitty gritty caring
3. Concentrate on Saling points of your app, let me do it for u.
4. We wil use Express with a framework [
  Which are helper functions, tools and rules that build Applications!!
  So, basically we have a clear way or at least outline that how we should
  structure our code and how to work with that framework to write cleaner code.
]
  Exress is not the only one!!!
  V JS
  Adonis.js as PHP laravel
  Koa
  Sails.js

   Highly flexible
